### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of a series of surveillance videos from various locations capturing everyday activities involving the usage of PPE. Each video is recorded using CCTV and captures various situations and conditions.

### Dataset Usage

This dataset can be used for various purposes, including:

1. Training object detection models to recognize the usage of PPE such as face masks,boots, vest, gloves, helmets and many more.
2. Analyzing compliance with PPE usage in public places, workplaces, or other areas recorded by CCTV.
3. Development and evaluation of image recognition and analysis algorithms for PPE usage compliance monitoring.

### License

The PPE dataset from CCTV is available under the license provided by Kaggle. Be sure to read and understand the terms of the license before using this dataset for your project.
